Redux Toolkit's createSlice and createAsyncThunk functions will be our trusty companions throughout this process.

ðŸ”„ State Management Made Effortless: With Redux Toolkit, handling state becomes a breeze. We'll witness how Redux Toolkit abstracts away the complexities of Redux boilerplate code, allowing us to focus on building functionality and delivering a seamless user experience.
